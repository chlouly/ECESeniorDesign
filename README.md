## Versioning

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for our project. Our project consists of two main components: the backend (Express) and the frontend (React), each with its own versioning.

### Backend Version (Express)

The current version of the backend is `0.5.0`. Major updates, new features, and bug fixes will increment the version number according to the Semantic Versioning guidelines.

### Frontend Version (React)

The current version of the frontend is `0.3.0`. Like the backend, version numbers will be updated based on major changes, feature additions, and bug fixes.
