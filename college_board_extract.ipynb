The text says that Dingle “skillfully winds” parts of palmetto palm plants around\\nsweetgrass plants to make baskets with an appearance that “no factory can reproduce.” This context suggests that Dingle’s\\nbaskets are handmade from sweetgrass and palmetto palm.\\xa0\\nChoice A is incorrect because the text describes how Dingle uses sweetgrass and palmetto palm to create her baskets, not\\nhow her baskets are “indicated by,” or signiﬁed by, sweetgrass and palmetto palm. Choice C is incorrect. Although Dingle’s\\nbaskets are described as being made using sweetgrass and palm, there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the baskets are\\n“represented by,” or exempliﬁed or portrayed by, sweetgrass and palmetto palm. Instead, the focus of the text is on Dingle’s\\nuse of sweetgrass and palmetto palm and the impossibility of replicating the appearance of her baskets using machines.\\nChoice D is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Dingle’s baskets are “collected with,” or brought\\ntogether in a group with, sweetgrass and palmetto palm.

Based on the text, the three editors just have different\\nstyles; they’re not necessarily more or less skilled. Choice C is incorrect. \"Ambiguous\" means \"unclear\" or \"open to multiple\\ninterpretations.\" However, it’s actually Johnson who encouraged multiple interpretations (\"diverse perspectives\"). Since Du\\nBois and Locke are said to \"diverge\" from Johnson, we can assume that the views they published were not ambiguous, but\\ninstead clear and ﬁrm (a \"uniﬁed vision\").

But some animators, such as Pixar’s Sanjay Patel, are focused on a\\ndifferent question.

Choice C is\\nincorrect. As the text explains, many computer animators strive for realistic environments and lighting, while others do not;\\nthis difference of approach relates to whether these components should be realistic, not to how realism can be achieved\\nusing current technology, and the text never suggests that animators are uncertain how to achieve it.
